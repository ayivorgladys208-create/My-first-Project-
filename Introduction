A brief introduction about myself 
My name is Gladys Ayivor. I developed my collaborative, leadership and effective communication skills. Led a group of 7 members to embark on surveys and made significant research on how ethnic groups could coexist peacefully. 
I led the team and we took part in community services 
I taught the students science related topics, tried hands-on practicals which enriched their knowledge , understanding and impacted significantly on their level of thinking. Which increased their performance up to 70%.
With this, I am able to build strong customer relationships through personalized experience and effective communication. Also being able to predict customer behaviour and improve  experience based on customer preferences.
